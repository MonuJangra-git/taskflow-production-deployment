Each issue above is documented in detail with root cause and fix in the [Challenges Solved](#-challenges-solved) section.
> If you're reviewing this project: these screenshots exist because I'd rather show the real debugging process than pretend everything worked on the first try.
> Errors aren't proof of failure — they're proof of the debugging that actually happened.
> Every one of these errors cost time and frustration — but each one taught something that no tutorial could: how production systems actually break, and how to reason through fixing them.
